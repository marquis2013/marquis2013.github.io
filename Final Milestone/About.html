		<h1>About Us</h1>
		The intent of creating this website was to share, sell, and promote the creative designs of the cups. The creator wanted to showcase not just only her talents but to show others imagination and creativity.With a careful planning with producing this website, I was able to organize the site to make it easy to navigate to see pre-designed, give the customer ideas for designs, and a form to start designing their own.<br>
		<br><h1>The Design</h1>
		I wanted to go with a simply design and structure that was appealing to the eyes and didn't overload the customer with too much information on one page. Since this product is a lot more attractive to female views, I didn't want to turn away male views. So, I kept the color scheme somewhat neutral, only showing famine colors in the banner of website to show a bit of the creatorâ€™s personality. Since I'm trying to keep every neutral I decided to keep the default time new roman format for the website.<br>
		<br> 3 out of the 5 pages are simple pages that showcase available cups for purchase or cups that were already to help the customer create an idea for a design. However, I tried to show different ways of showing the pictures. The Home page shows the pictures as a gallery, the pre-made page is a table, and the showcase page is the image placed on the page in rows. The build page is a simple form page that can be filled out and sent to the creator to start designing a cup. And finally, the about page is here to give you some context on this little project.<br>
		<br><h1>Future Improvements</h1>
		Since this website is meant to sell cups, I would love to add a shopping cart feature to site. If you design to but a pre-made cup or design a new one use you have submitted or chosen the fee goes to the cart, waiting for you to pay to be processed. This next I idea is way more advanced than the shopping cart but it would be pretty cool to have a feature where customers could place their designs on a virtual cup and then that image could be sent to the creator to be made.
